# Early-Stage-Diabetes-Risk-Prediction
A data science project developed for detecting diabetes risks based on patients' demography and habits.

This project is created for my "final year project" for one of the university course, Data Science Project. In this project, we implemented what we had learned from other data science courses and applied it to real-life problems; in this case, I chose to study the relationship between the people's demographic and habits with the diabetes disease.

For the dataset, I'm using the 2019 BRFSS Survey Data and Documentation, which can be found in this link: https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2019.html . I also included a file for you to convert the SAS XPT file to Excel CSV file.
